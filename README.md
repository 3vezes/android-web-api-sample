# Sample Android App Using the Spotify Web API Wrapper

This sample app uses [the Spotify Web API Wrapper](https://github.com/kaaes/spotify-web-api-android) to make calls to the Spotify API. This code in particular searches for artists and displays the results in logcat.

[There is also a webcast for the Android Developer Nanodegree](https://plus.google.com/events/cdp78mckdd6hmg451ou41duc39s?authkey=COHHyoWfo5ukrQE) that goes through this example code.
